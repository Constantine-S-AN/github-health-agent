# GitHub Health Agent (Zypher + MCP)

A small CLI agent built with [Zypher](https://zypher.corespeed.io) that analyzes the **“health”** of a GitHub repository.

Given a repo like `owner/repo` (or a full GitHub URL), the agent:

- Uses the **GitHub MCP server** to inspect issues / PRs / recent activity.
- Computes a **0–100 health score** based on activity, backlog, and maintenance signals.
- Outputs a concise **Markdown report** with:
  - Health Score  
  - Indicators (activity, issues, releases)  
  - Risks  
  - Recommended Next Actions
